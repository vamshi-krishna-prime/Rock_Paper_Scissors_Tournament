As per'RUBRIC PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS', the code must contain "A player that remembers and imitates what the human player did in the previous round".
However 'python_code.py' has been upgraded to the condition - "A player that remembers and imitates what the opponent did in the previous round". 
In case, changes to the rubric rule set is not allowed, an another file - 'python_code_2.py' has also been attached for project assessment.
