1) Thank you for the valuable review. The required change has been made as per the specifications. 
2) As per the review - "code validation with 'pycodestyle' failed on many lines". However, the 'python_code.py' file does not exhibit such behaviour in my 'GitBash'. 
For reference an image(python 3 rps project pycodestyle.JPG) has been attached to this repository. Install 'colorama' and 'termcolor' using pip, if you are using 'GitBash'.
3) As per'RUBRIC PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS', the code must contain "A player that remembers and imitates what the human player did in the previous round".
4) However 'python_code.py' has been upgraded to the condition - "A player that remembers and imitates what the opponent did in the previous round". 
5) In case, changes to the rubric rule set is not allowed, an another file - 'python_code_2.py' has also been attached for project assessment.
